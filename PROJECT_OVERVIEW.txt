MEDEXPLAIN - PROJECT OVERVIEW & DOCUMENTATION
===========================================

1. PROJECT SUMMARY
------------------
MedExplain is an AI-powered application designed to help users understand their medical reports. It simplifies complex medical terminology into easy-to-understand summaries and provides an interactive chatbot for follow-up questions.

2. FOLDER STRUCTURE

2. **Upload Reports**: Easily upload photos or PDFs of medical reports (Blood tests, X-rays, etc.).
3. **AI Summary**: Instantly receive a simplified, plain-English summary of your report.
4. **Interactive Chatbot**: Ask questions about your report (e.g., "What does high cholesterol mean?") and get AI-driven answers based specifically on your data.
5. **Compare Reports**: Select two different reports (e.g., tests from January vs. June) to see how your health metrics have changed.
6. **Report History**: Access a library of all your previously uploaded reports.
7. **Medical Guide**:
   - **Body Guide**: Visual guide to understand health relative to body parts.
   - **Symptom Checker**: Basic tools to check symptoms (functionality implied by codebase).
   - **Medical Dictionary**: Explanations for complex terms.

B. Technical Details
--------------------
**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React.js (Vite), CSS (Vanilla/Custom)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini (via Backend Services)

**Key Backend Routes (API Endpoints):**
1. **Auth** (`/auth`): Handles user authentication.
2. **Reports** (`/reports`):
   - `POST /upload`: Accepts file uploads, performs OCR/Analysis, returns summary.
   - `GET /`: Lists all reports for the logged-in user.
   - `GET /summary`: Fetches the summary for a specific report.
3. **Chatbot** (`/chatbot`):
   - `POST /session`: Starts a new chat session for a report.
   - `POST /message`: Sends a user message and returns an AI response.
   - `GET /session/<id>`: Retrieves chat history.
4. **Comparison** (`/reports/compare`): Analyzes differences between two report documents.
5. **Voice Chat** (`/voice-chatbot`): Handles voice-based interactions.
6. **Auxiliary**:
   - `/symptom-checker`: Service for symptom analysis.
   - `/medical-term`: Service for defining terms.
   - `/medicine`: Service for medicine information.

**Frontend Components:**
- **UploadReport**: Drag-and-drop interface for files.
- **SummaryView**: Renders the AI analysis (Markdown support).
- **Chatbot**: Floating chat interface utilizing the backend chat API.
- **ReportList**: Scrollable list of user's history.
- **CompareReports**: UI for selecting and viewing comparisons.
- **BodyGuide**: Interactive visual component.

4. CURRENT STATUS
-----------------
- The application is fully structured with a separation of concerns directly between Frontend and Backend.
- Core flows (Upload -> Analyze -> Chat) are implemented.
- Comparison and History features are integrated.
- Mobile responsiveness is being actively worked on (as per recent updates).
